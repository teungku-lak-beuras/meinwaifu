including bugs and errors.
2. `Important`: important and will be implemented in the near future.
3. `Plan`: important and will be implemented only after everything which is more
important than this no longer exist.

### Pull and feature requests

Talking is cheap, send patches. If you wish a bug to be fixed or something
to be added, send the solution: be it the code or the illustration. Otherwise
sit down and shut up. I am sorry, I really appreciate your enthusiasm and I
adore it, really; but I don't wish to give you false hope or bad impression
about me.

## Legal

Although I try to avoid anything related to legal/law stuffs, it's inevitable.

```

The work of arts, including but not limited to, embedded pictures, fonts, or
musics, is owned by its author and I do not have any right upon it.

If the author of aforementioned work-of-arts wishes to be credited or even

```

Yes, you read it right. `GNU GPLv3`. Why? Because in a matter of knowledge,
I am a communist: knowledge `must` be free. Heck, even in these days of free
knowledge everywhere, many people are even dumber every second.

But fear not, dear. I will not do things that are destructive, harmful, or
against the laws. When I say that knowledge must be free, this is the proof of
my will: I expose my knowledge to the world for free. See the difference?
Instead of changing others actions, I change mine! `:3`

## Backgrounds

### What is this?

This repository is the source code of `Mein Waifu` Android application. It is
made with Kotlin Compose. The purpose of this project is to serve as both
challenge and proof of  my Kotlin coding skill.

The application's name `Mein Waifu` roughly means "my waifu" in English. I got
the inspiration of using Germanic word because of Dutch colonialism in East Indie
(Netherlands-Indie, now known as Indonesia). But, ignorantly I mistook the word
"mein" (Deutsch/German) instead of "mijn" (Dutch/Netherlands). Since both are
Germanic languages, I leave it as is.

Oh, and don't get me wrong. I am opposed to colonialism. But I admire their
sheer will and ability for conquering such vast amount of lands, **without
smartphones, Minecraft: PE, and AirPods**. Many of their infrastructures are
also still on duty until this second. That's a whole another league of
engineering level.
